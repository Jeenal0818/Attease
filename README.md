# 🎯 Attease – Smart Attendance Tracker

Attease is a smart, efficient, and secure attendance tracking system built with Python that uses face recognition and GPS location validation to automatically mark student or employee attendance. The project is backed by a MySQL database for seamless data management.

Say goodbye to proxy attendance and manual logs – Attease ensures only authenticated, physically-present individuals can mark themselves present.

🚀 Features

1. Face Recognition-Based Authentication
- Uses OpenCV and face recognition libraries to verify the identity of the user.

2. Location-Based Validation
- Ensures attendance can only be marked from a predefined location (e.g., classroom or office).

3. MySQL Database Integration
- Uses mysql-connector-python for efficient and secure storage and retrieval of attendance data.

4. Real-Time Attendance Marking
- Attendance is marked in real-time with time stamps.

5. Admin Dashboard (Coming Soon)
- Visualize attendance reports, manage users, and export data.

📌 Use Cases

1. Schools and Colleges

2. Offices and Co-working spaces

3. Labs and Research Centers

4. Online exams with physical presence validation

🔒 Security & Privacy

Face data is stored securely.

✨ Future Enhancements

1. Web-based admin dashboard

2. OTP/email-based double authentication

3. Mobile app integration

4. Auto sync with cloud storage
